Javascript  {Default}
    1. Synchronous      [   One by one execution of code.   ] 
    2. Single Threaded  [   At one thread everything is executed - comperevitily slow language (But never work alone)   ]

Execution Context
    1. Execute one line of code at a time
    2. Each operation waitsfor the last one to complete before executing
        Call Stack      Memory Heap

Blocking Code and Non Blocking Code
    BC - block the flow of program  -   read file Sync 
    NBC - don't block execution     -   read file Async 

Files are read in node js and not in Javascript.

Javascript Engine - alone Javascript
Web API -> DOM      OR      Environment -> Node 
Promise Queue / High Priority Queue
Task Queue

Web API - set remainder for some Task   {   Register Call Back  }
|-> Set Timeout, Set Interval, Fetch() 
|-> RCB - register all the events

Task Queue - to set order for the tasks in Web API or Environment.

A Stack Process
{Call Stack} JS Engine ->{Call}  [ Web API/Environment ->{events} Register Call Back ] -> {task} Task Queue ->  {Add to Call Stack} JS Engine [Call Stack]    

For example:
1
(0),2   -    It will take time to get call as event.
3   -   Till that time this will be executed.

Fetch() -   Similar as Task Queue but with some Priority.   -   {Promise}
