<!-- Setting up Local Variables - Offline Environment -->

Js is executed on browser or in environment.


Difference between .js and .txt file :-
    They both can be treated as source code.
    Source code in js file holds special meaning.
    All programming languages comes up with there own extension.
    If we inject js file in a software then it will get executed.
    All the softwares have a capability to understand the structure of a syntax, accept the file with the help of extension.
    Software accept the file with respect of its syntax.    [ Software - Compiler or Interpretor ]


In case of JS this software,
    * was hidden inside the browser for many years. 
        It was not easily available. 
        Console or browser were used to run js.
        Its configuration and setup was a task for users.
    * nowadays these software are made standalone and easily availave for execution. 
        Now Js is not just a browser language or frontend language, it is now used for backend, mobile applications, pretty much everywhere.


Environment for javascript,
    Node js, env and installation similar to python.
    V8 engine.
    Deno js ( founder same as node js )


Install node. Check version by "node -v".   And run files by "node filename.js"


And software that execute this file :-


<!-- Save and work on Github - Online Environment -->

Online code execution environment. And allow us to build our portfolio.

Create a new repository on github.

After creating repo, click on code (codespace). And then "Create codespace for main".
Behind the scene a computer is been setup for you. [Instance]
Initially there is no software inside this.

Now we have to create env for node js here.
File -> View -> Command Palate. 
And write "conatiner". Click on "Codespace: 'Add Dev Container Configuration Files' ", some files will be added for configuration in your computer instance, so that we you need python or javascript you will get by default.

Saving all of this work on your repo.
Click of the "Soucre Control" icon, Stage Changes. Write a message and then "Commit".
